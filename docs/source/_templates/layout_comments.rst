the layout.html file in this folder only slightly adapts the current ReadTheDocs theme. It is not possible to completly restructure the theme with this file, only appearences of webpage items are adjustable. 

To people knowledgabel to html and css style sheets this might be obvious, but for the rest: 

1. Find the names for the different objects on the webpage
I found the "a" as the hyperlink name on this webpage:

2. Find the names of the attributes you want to change

3. Stick to html coding syntax and you will see changes in the documentation
